TRANSCENDENT I: F.A.L.A.N.X. (The System) 

Role: Tactical Vanguard / Damage Siphon Tank Theme: The original military-grade "System" designed for absolute protection and area denial. 
Template: Component

1. THE PILOT: Commander Elias Vance 
Background: A veteran tactical lead chosen for his high cognitive sync rate with the FALANX core. 
Layered Defense Systems: Commander Vance manages a sophisticated multi-tier shielding array:
Inner Layer: Ancile Shield: The primary defense core. It can protect from all standard physical and energy threats but is vulnerable to specialized Plasma Attacks. 
Capacity: 100,000 HP. 
Outer Layer: Aegis Shield: An advanced energy barrier that can block any type of incoming damage without exception. 
Capacity: 60,000 HP. 

2. BASE FORM COMPONENTS & ABILITIES 
In his standard form, FALANX utilizes four modular components. Each features a signature "Active Ability." 

[COMPONENT: SWORD] Protocol Edge 
Description: A high-frequency blade designed for precision melee. 
Ability: TITAN SLASH: A brief startup charge followed by a massive, high-damage horizontal sweep. 

[COMPONENT: GUN] The Enforcer 
Description: A versatile mid-range ballistic rifle. 
Ability: LASER BEAM: The barrel overclocks to fire a continuous, concentrated beam of light. 

[COMPONENT: EXPLOSIVE] Calamity Shells 
Description: Shoulder-mounted ordinance launchers. 
Ability: CHIMERA: Launches 5 homing rockets in a burst. This can be repeated 5 times (total of 25 rockets). 

[COMPONENT: SHIELD] The Kinetic Siphon 
Description: A heavy physical shield that siphons 30% of damage taken by nearby allies to its own charge meter. 
Ability: SHATTER: The shield breaks into floating energy fragments called the AEGIS, providing 360-degree protection. 

3. SUPPORT SYSTEMS: THE SENTINEL DRONE 
Designation: SD-2 "Kestrel"
Ability 1: Missile Barrage: Automatically fires micro-missiles at nearby enemies every 1.5 seconds, dealing consistent chip damage. 
Ability 2: Emergency Reboot: Whenever any shield layer (Ancile or Aegis) drops to 0% HP, the drone instantly restores 15% of that shield's maximum health. 
Cooldown: 10 Minutes. 
Ability 3: Combat Link: Provides a permanent 5% damage boost to all of FALANX's weapon systems. 
Ability 4: Ghost Protocol: Every 15 minutes, the first hit taken by FALANX triggers an emergency cloaking field, making the unit invisible for 5 seconds to allow for repositioning. 

4. TITAN FORM (The Walking Exclusion Zone) 
When FALANX enters his Titan Form, his combat style shifts from a warrior to a strategic hazard. 
Titan Passive Customization: In Titan Form, FALANX can equip only 1 specialized passive module.
