🌀 TRANSCENDENT VIII: M.I.R.A.G.E. (The False Reflection)
Role: Illusionist / Trickster Saboteur / Battlefield Misdirector
Theme: A master of perception who bends light and reality to create false targets, distort positioning, and confuse enemies.
Template: Type + Stage

1. Core Mechanic — Refraction Identity
- Mirage projects false clones that mimic ally or enemy movements.
- Clones have no HP but can absorb targeting priority, projectiles, or ability locks.
- Mirage can swap places with a clone (short cooldown), instantly repositioning.
- Passive: Every time Mirage swaps, enemies in a small radius are blinded for 1s.

2. Base Abilities
- Spectral Divide
- Creates a wall of refracted light. Allies passing through gain invisibility for 2s.
- Enemies passing through are slowed and lose targeting accuracy.
- Phantom Step
- Mirage becomes intangible for 3s, leaving behind a clone.
- If the clone is destroyed, Mirage gains a shield equal to 10% max HP.
- Echo Strike
- Sends a clone forward to attack with a holographic weapon.
- Deals reduced damage but applies “Confusion” (enemy attacks have a 20% chance to miss for 5s).

3. Signature Mechanic — Hall of Mirrors
- Mirage creates a mirror zone (20m radius).
- Inside the zone, enemies see multiple copies of Mirage and allies.
- Real units are indistinguishable until Mirage attacks.
- Allies inside gain +10% evasion.

4. Ultimate — Infinite Reflection
- Mirage splits into 5 perfect clones for 10s.
- Each clone has the “Boss” attribute (immune to debuffs, but 50% HP of Mirage).
- Enemies cannot tell which is real — Mirage can swap freely between clones.
- At the end, all clones collapse into a blinding explosion, stunning enemies for 3s.

5. Passives
- Lightbend: Projectiles aimed at Mirage have a 25% chance to curve away.
- Mirror Memory: Every time Mirage dodges an attack, his next ability deals +15% damage.
- False Ally: Mirage can disguise himself as an ally for 3s (visual only, no stat change).
