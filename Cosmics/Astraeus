1. Overview
1) Astraeus is a zone‑control, utility‑heavy character who embodies stellar life cycles.
Playstyle centers on positioning, timing, and layered control: orbiting planets for constant pressure, drones for flexible roles (support or Meteor Shower), deployables for map control, and a powerful but costly Ascension. 
The Solar System deployable is an optional extra ability that creates a temporary star + orbiting planets system; it is an added ability to the assencion.

2. Detailed Abilities
1) Stellar Core Passive
  - Fusion Stacks: Gain stacks by dealing or receiving damage (max 5). Stacks alter ability parameters and visuals.
    - 1–2 stacks Protostar: Lower ability costs; stronger heals.
    - 3 stacks Main Sequence: Balanced stats; turret fire rate increased.
    - 4 stacks Red Giant: Larger AoE radii; slower movement.
    - 5 stacks Magnetar: Abilities gain burst modifiers and chance to trigger a Flare.
  - Regeneration: Small passive health/energy regen that scales with stacks.
  - Decay: Stacks decay slowly out of combat.
2) Pulsar Beacon Q
  - Deployable turret that rotates and fires a narrow beam every 1.2s.
  - Placement: Up to 2 active beacons. Beacons pierce and apply a short slow; repeated hits on the same target build a Timing Pulse that deals bonus damage on the 3rd hit.
  - Synergy: Faster fire rate at Main Sequence; chance to chain at Magnetar.
  - Upgrades: Ion Beacon (faster), Chain Beacon (chains), Void Beacon (explodes on destruction).
3) Nebular Veil W
  - Ground or self cast cloud lasting several seconds.
  - Allies inside: Gradual healing and reduced incoming damage.
  - Enemies inside: Reduced vision and movement.
  - Interaction: Pulsar Beacon beams refract inside the cloud, creating radial pulses. Protostar increases healing; Red Giant increases radius.
4) Magnetic Flare E
  - Short-range burst that pulls enemies inward, deals damage, and stuns if within a critical radius.
  - At 5 stacks: Becomes a Flare that strips shields and leaves a lingering magnetic field that slows.
  - Visuals: Auroral arcs and magnetic ribbons.
5) Planetary Orbits Passive
  - Orbiting planets (start with 2, can increase) rotate at fixed radius and damage enemies on contact.
  - Planet types:
    - Rocky: High single-hit damage + small stun.
    - Comet: Lower damage + lingering slow.
    - Gas Mini‑Jovian: Lower direct damage + small AoE pulse on impact.
  - Mechanics: Each planet has a per-target cooldown; player can command radius or focus briefly. Planets are predictable but powerful in close quarters.
6) Cluster Drones Helper
  - Three orbiting drones with selectable modes:
    - Support: Small healing pulses or shield bubbles.
    - Striker: Small damage shots, target enemies.
    - Meteor Shower: Launches 3–6 meteoroids over 2–3s to a target area; meteors have travel time and AoE impact.
  - Mode toggle: Short channel to switch modes; drones auto‑revert after duration.
  - Upgrades: More meteors, fragmentation, or added burn/knockback.
7) Galactic Bastion Mothership
  - Large deployable that anchors a zone: emits a gravity well, healing aura, and periodically launches drones or beacons.
  - Mechanics: Long cooldown, destructible, and while active Astraeus gains reduced cooldowns. Can be upgraded to spawn more drones or extend radius.

3. Ultimate / Ascended Form
- Singularity Ascension (R) — Transformative Ultimate
  - Activation: Consumes all Fusion Stacks and enters Ascended state for a fixed duration (e.g., 12–18s).
    - Effects while Ascended:
      - Gravity Field: Constant AoE that pulls enemies inward and reduces their attack speed.
    - Ability Rework:
      - Pulsar Beacon → Event Horizon: Beacons become stationary singularities that periodically emit radial shockwaves.
      - Nebular Veil → Event Horizon Shroud: Veil becomes a dense accretion disk that massively heals allies and reflects a portion of incoming damage as energy pulses.
      - Magnetic Flare → GRB Burst: Converts to a directional, high‑damage gamma burst with long range and huge cooldown.
    - Added Ability: Solar System Deployable:
      - Purpose: Added ability — a separate, optional deployable that places a Star Core with multiple orbiting planets. It’s an extra tactical tool.
      - Star Core: Stationary object that emits an aura (healing or ally buff / enemy debuff) and periodically fires a focused pulse. It is destructible.
      - Orbiting Planets: Autonomous planets orbit the core; each has an active effect (impact damage, EMP pulse, shield bubble). Planets can be commanded to crash into enemies for a one‑time heavy strike (long cooldown).
      - Duration and Limits: Lasts for the Solar System duration + short remnant; only one Solar System can exist at a time.
      - Synergy: Works with Pulsar Beacons and Nebular Veil but does not change their base behavior. Drones can be directed to support the Solar System.
      - Counterplay: Enemies can destroy the core or planets; mobility and long‑range attacks are effective counters.
    - Passive: Immense damage resistance but reduced mobility.
  - End: On expiration, a remnant (mini black hole) remains for a few seconds, pulling and damaging enemies; Astraeus is briefly weakened (cooldown penalty) to balance power.

4. Synergies and Interactions
  - Drones + Planets: Meteor Shower softens groups for planet collisions; meteors can create slow zones to increase planet hits.
  - Stacks: Fusion Stacks modify meteor behavior and planet speed/damage.
  - Mothership + Solar System: Galactic Bastion can link to the Solar System for extended effects, but the Solar System remains an independent extra ability.
  - Tactical combos: Use Nebular Veil to hide Solar System placement, then Meteor Shower to force enemies into orbit paths; Ascend to lock fights with gravity
