🌪️ New Character: Tempestra
Concept:
Tempestra is the living embodiment of a supercell thunderstorm. She doesn’t just strike with lightning—she brings the full chaos of the storm: swirling tornado winds, crushing hail, torrential rain, and booming thunder. Designed as a controller brawler who manipulates the battlefield with disruptive weather effects.

Core Stats
- Rarity: Legendary
- Role: Controller / Area Denial

Main Attack — Hail Volley
- Fires three hail shards in a spread.
- Each shard deals moderate damage and slows enemies briefly (icy impact).
- Overcharge effect: shards ricochet once, hitting extra targets and leaving puddles that slow movement.

Super — Eye of the Tempest
- Summons a mini tornado at target area.
- Tornado pulls enemies inward, dealing damage over time.
- Random lightning arcs strike inside the vortex for bonus burst.
- Overcharge effect: tornado expands, spawns hail rain that pelts enemies in the zone, and briefly blinds enemies (reduced vision).

Gadgets
- Stormfront Burst
- Creates a sudden gust around Tempestra, knocking back nearby enemies and deflecting projectiles.
- Overcharge: gust also spawns a short‑lived mini tornado that slows enemies.
- Thunderclap
- Tempestra slams the ground, creating a shockwave that briefly stuns enemies in a small radius.
- Overcharge: shockwave also silences abilities for 1s.

Star Powers
- Star Power 1 — Torrential Flow
Rain puddles left by hail shards last longer and slow more.
- Star Power 2 — Cyclone Core
Tornado Super pulls harder and deals slightly more damage per tick.

Hypercharge — Supercell Overdrive
For 8 seconds, Tempestra becomes a full thunderstorm:
- Main Attack: hail shards ricochet and leave puddles.
- Super: tornado doubles size, adds hail rain + lightning arcs.
- Gadget: both gadgets gain their Overcharge effects automatically.
- Star Powers: both are active simultaneously during Overdrive.
Visual: swirling storm clouds around her body, glowing eyes like lightning, rain streaks falling constantly, and a booming thunderclap when activated.

Playstyle
- Strengths: Excellent at controlling zones, punishing grouped enemies, and disrupting pushes.
- Weaknesses: Damage is spread out over time; vulnerable to snipers and burst assassins.
