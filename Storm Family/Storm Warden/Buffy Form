Stormwarden — Lightning Fusion Brawler
Concept
A mythic skirmisher who embodies rare positive lightning and storm phenomena. 
Excels at burst zoning and punishing clustered enemies by combining forked strikes, chaining arcs, vertical piercing jets, diffuse sheet flashes, and disruptive red‑sprite effects. 
High risk, high reward playstyle that rewards multi‑target hits and smart positioning.
Abilities
Main Attack Conductor Bolts
- Fire pattern: Short burst of three bolts in a cone.
- Bolt 1 Forked: Primary bolt deals 900 and splits on hit into two forks dealing 450 each.
- Bolt 2 Anvil Crawler: Secondary bolt chains to up to 2 nearby enemies, 350 per chain link.
- Bolt 3 Sheet: Diffuse flash that reveals and slows enemies in a small radius for 1.2s.
- Purpose: Multi‑target stacking to build Hypercharge and control space.
Super Positive Tempest
- Cast: Targeted area strike that summons a massive positive lightning impact.
- Effects:
- Center hit: 2800 damage (Prime: 3800).
- Blue Jets: Several vertical piercing beams spawn and travel forward, 600 per tick, ignore shields.
- Red Sprite Swarm: Sprites orbit the zone for 6s; each sprite has a chance to proc a short stun or silence on enemy ability use.
- Use: Zone denial, finishers, breaking defensive formations.

Gadgets and Buffies
Gadget 1 Ion Anchor (revised)
- Charges: 2 per match; Cooldown: 20s.
- Effect: Absorbs next projectile or reduces next incoming damage by 60%, then detonates into chain lightning (700 AoE). If used while Skyward Tether is active, detonation spawns an extra blue jet beam.
- Gadget Buffie interaction: With a Gadget Buffie, Ion Anchor gains a one‑time reflect that bounces the next projectile back to its source before detonating.
Gadget 2 Skyward Tether (new)
- Charges: 1 per match; Cooldown: 30s.
- Effect: Launches a tethered anchor; within 3s Stormwarden may teleport to it. While tethered, the anchor emits a vertical piercing blue jet that deals moderate damage and disables movement for 0.6s. If unused, it detonates after 4s into a small chain lightning.
- Design: Mobility, aggressive repositioning, and combo setup for multi‑target Hypercharge.
Buffies (new mechanic)
- Gadget Buffie: Modifies next gadget use (extra mechanic or extra charge).
- Star Power Buffie: Temporarily upgrades or grants a Star Power effect.
- Hypercharge Buffie: Grants instant Hypercharge stacks or modifies stacking rules for a short window.
- Stormwarden examples:
- Gadget Buffie: Ion Anchor Augment adds reflect.
- Star Power Buffie: Sprite Dominion Augment guarantees first sprite stun for 8s.
- Hypercharge Buffie: Tempest Core grants +2 Hypercharge and prevents decay for 6s.

Hypercharge and Star Powers
Hypercharge Passive Storm Accumulator
- Stacks: Gain a stack when Conductor Bolts hits ≥2 enemies or when forks/chains connect.
- Prime: At 3 stacks, next Super becomes Positive Tempest Prime (center damage +1000, jets longer range, sprites guarantee first proc).
- Decay: Stacks decay slowly out of combat. Visual cue: bright white aura and crackling core.
Star Power 1 Sprite Dominion
- Effect: Red sprites gain increased proc chance; on proc apply a short electrified DoT scaling with enemy missing health.
Star Power 2 Anvil Resonance
- Effect: Each chained hit from the anvil crawler restores a small portion of Stormwarden’s health per enemy hit.

Playstyle Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths
- Devastating against grouped enemies and clustered objectives.
- Strong finishing potential with Hypercharge + Prime Super.
- Flexible: can play midrange poke or frontline with sustain via Anvil Resonance.
- Gadget combos enable clutch survival and aggressive plays.
Weaknesses
- Super is telegraphed and can be dodged or avoided.
- Relies on multi‑target hits to charge Hypercharge efficiently.
- Vulnerable to long‑range snipers and high‑mobility assassins who avoid cone bursts.
- Gadget and buffie dependence can make power spikes situational.

Counters Synergies and Tuning Notes
Counters
- High‑mobility brawlers that dodge cone and jets.
- Long‑range snipers who outrange Conductor Bolts.
- Heavy shielders who absorb center Super.
Synergies
- Area denial brawlers who trap enemies into the Super zone.
- Healers who sustain Stormwarden while he chains.
- Crowd control brawlers who group enemies for maximum chain/fork value.
Tuning tips
- Reduce chain damage or chain targets if oppressive in groups.
- Adjust Hypercharge stack rate or decay to balance Prime frequency.
- Limit Gadget Buffie availability to avoid constant gadget dominance.
- Provide clear visual telegraphs for buffie activation and Prime to allow counterplay.

Visuals Skins and Flavor
Visual design
- Appearance: Sleek armored figure with a bright white core; red sprite motes orbit shoulders; blue jet trails from gauntlets; occasional golden sparks when Prime is ready.
- Animations: Conductor Bolts have a quick electric windup; Super summons a thundercloud halo and a blinding white strike.
- Sound: Layered thunderclaps, sprite chimes, and deep bass for positive lightning impact.
Skin ideas
- Stormwarden Prime: White and gold palette; Super has golden jets.
- Tempest Warden Legendary: Ethereal translucent body; sprites become phoenix‑like motes; Super leaves a lingering stormfield.
