Hypercharge Overhaul
Name Storm Accumulator Overcharge
Core idea Hypercharge is now a powerful internal resource that, when reaching 3 stacks, triggers Overcharge. 
Overcharge lasts 8 seconds and augments every mechanic with unique, non‑stat effects (not simple damage buffs). 
Overcharge is consumed on use and has a cooldown before stacks can be rebuilt.

How to gain stacks
- Hitting ≥2 enemies with Conductor Bolts grants 1 stack.
- Each fork or chain connecting grants +1 stack (max 1 per bolt hit).
- Center Super hit grants 2 stacks if it hits at least one enemy.
- Stacks decay slowly out of combat.
Overcharge Visual Bright white core with golden arcs; weapon and sprites glow intensely.
Overcharge Effects Summary (applies simultaneously for 8s)
- Main Attack Augment Forked bolts become charged forks that leave short‑lived static nodes on hit; nodes pulse after 1s dealing area damage and counting as hits for stacking.
- Super Augment Positive Tempest becomes Prime Tempest: center becomes a focused chain detonator that spawns extra blue jets in radial directions and guarantees first sprite proc on each enemy hit.
- Gadget Augment Ion Anchor gains a one‑time reflect and spawns an extra blue jet on detonation; Skyward Tether teleports and immediately triggers a piercing jet volley at the arrival point that disables movement for 0.8s.
- Star Power Augment Sprite Dominion guarantees the first sprite stun and converts it into a short electrified tether that links enemies, causing subsequent sprite procs to jump between linked targets; Anvil Resonance heals more per chained hit and grants a brief damage shield on each heal tick.
Balance notes Overcharge is powerful but time‑limited and requires multi‑target play to reach. Cooldown on rebuilding full stacks prevents constant uptime.

Abilities
Main Attack Conductor Bolts
- Pattern: Burst of three bolts in a cone.
- Components:
- Forked Bolt (primary): 900 damage; splits into two forks of 450 on hit. Under Overcharge forks leave static nodes that pulse for 300 AoE after 1s.
- Anvil Crawler Bolt: Chains to up to 2 nearby enemies, 350 per chain link; under Overcharge chains can hit one extra target and heal Stormwarden per hit.
- Sheet Bolt: Diffuse flash that reveals and slows enemies for 1.2s; under Overcharge the sheet also disorients (reduced aim speed) for 0.8s.
Super Positive Tempest
- Base: Targeted area strike. Center 2800 damage (Prime 3800). Blue jets spawn and travel forward, 600 per tick. Red sprites orbit zone for 6s with chance to stun/silence on ability use.
- Prime Tempest (Overcharge): Center becomes a detonating node that spawns radial blue jets (piercing) and guarantees sprite procs on first hit; jets ignore shields and leave lingering static fields that slow and reveal for 3s.

Gadgets
Gadget 1 Ion Anchor (revised)
- Charges: 2; Cooldown: 20s.
- Base Effect: Absorbs next projectile or reduces next incoming damage by 60%, then detonates into chain lightning (700 AoE). If used while Skyward Tether is active, detonation spawns an extra blue jet beam.
- Overcharge Augment: Ion Anchor gains a one‑time reflect that bounces the next projectile back to its source and detonates into a larger chain that counts as multiple hits for stacking.
Gadget 2 Skyward Tether
- Charges: 1; Cooldown: 30s.
- Base Effect: Launches a tether anchor; Stormwarden may teleport to it within 3s. Anchor emits a vertical piercing blue jet that deals moderate damage and disables movement for 0.6s. If unused, detonates after 4s into small chain lightning.
- Overcharge Augment: Teleport immediately triggers a volley of piercing jets at arrival and increases disable to 0.8s; unused detonation spawns extra static nodes.

Star Powers
Star Power 1 Sprite Dominion
- Base: Red sprites gain increased proc chance; on proc apply a short electrified DoT scaling with missing health.
- Overcharge Augment: First sprite proc is guaranteed stun and creates an electrified tether linking nearby enemies for subsequent sprite procs.
Star Power 2 Anvil Resonance
- Base: Each chained hit restores a small portion of Stormwarden’s health per enemy hit.
- Overcharge Augment: Each heal tick also grants a brief damage shield and chains can hit one extra target.

Numeric Tuning Examples
- HP: 4200
- Primary bolt center: 900
- Fork damage: 450 each
- Chain damage: 350 per link
- Sheet slow: 30% for 1.2s
- Super center: 2800 (Prime 3800)
- Blue jet tick: 600 per tick
- Ion Anchor detonation AoE: 700
- Overcharge duration: 8s
- Stacks to Overcharge: 3
(Adjust numbers to fit your balance goals; Overcharge focuses on mechanical changes rather than raw multipliers.)

Playstyle Notes
Strengths
- Massive, multi‑layered power spike when Overcharged.
- Excellent at punishing grouped enemies and finishing fights.
- Versatile: poke, zone, reposition, and clutch defense with gadgets.
- Overcharge encourages aggressive, multi‑target play and rewards skillful timing.
Weaknesses
