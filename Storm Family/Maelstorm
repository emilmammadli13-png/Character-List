🌪️ MAELSTROM — The Hurricane Titan
Concept:
Maelstrom is the living force of a hurricane: swirling winds, torrential rain, storm surge, and relentless pressure. 
Unlike the sharp strikes of Stormwarden or the chaotic bursts of Tempestra, Maelstrom is about sustained dominance—slowly grinding enemies down with constant wind and water damage while controlling huge areas of the battlefield.

Main Attack — Gale Crush
- Swings forward with a wind‑charged strike.
- Deals moderate damage and knocks enemies back slightly.
- Overcharge effect: creates a swirling gust that lingers for 2s, damaging and slowing enemies inside.

Super — Eye of the Hurricane
- Summons a massive storm zone around Maelstrom for 6s.
- Enemies inside are slowed, take damage over time, and are gradually pulled toward the center.
- Overcharge effect: storm zone expands, spawns flood surges at the edges that knock enemies inward, and lightning arcs randomly strike inside.

Gadgets
- Storm Surge
  - Creates a sudden wave that pushes enemies back in a line.
  - Overcharge: wave also leaves puddles that slow movement.
- Cyclone Guard
  - Surrounds Maelstrom with a rotating wind shield that blocks one projectile per second for 3s.
  - Overcharge: shield reflects blocked projectiles back at enemies.

Star Powers
- Star Power 1 — Endless Winds
Gale Crush leaves behind a short‑lived gust zone that slows enemies.
- Star Power 2 — Storm Surge Mastery
Flood surges from the Super deal extra knockback and damage to tanks.

Hypercharge — Cataclysmic Hurricane
For 8s, Maelstrom becomes a full hurricane:
- Main Attack: Gale Crush creates permanent gust zones that stack.
- Super: Eye of the Hurricane doubles in size, adds lightning arcs + flood surges.
- Gadgets: Both gain their Overcharge effects automatically.
- Star Powers: Both activate simultaneously during Hypercharge.
Visual: swirling hurricane cloud around the entire battlefield, rain pouring, lightning flashing, and Maelstrom glowing at the center like the “eye.”


Would you like me to sketch Maelstrom’s visual design guide (armor, aura, effects, silhouette) so you can draw him alongside Stormwarden and Tempestra to complete the storm trio?
