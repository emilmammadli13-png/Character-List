🔥 BOILER — Base Form

⚔️ Attack — Steam Piston Slam (SPS)

🛠 Mechanic
Pressure builds (0.4s wind-up)
Pistons thrust forward
Medium frontal cone hitbox
Hits Ground

💥 Damage
Medium AoE damage
1.7s attack speed

🌡 Heat Interaction
Boiler generates Heat from:
  - His attacks
  - Nearby ally damage
  - Teapot explosions

🔥 Scald Effect

ONLY activates when Heat > 40%.

When active:
  - Small burn damage over 2s
  - -5% enemy attack speed

If Heat < 40%:
  - SPS deals normal damage only.

🌡 Base Heat System (Boiler)

Heat Range: 0 → 100
When Heat reaches 100:
  - Triggers Overheat Mode (8s)
  - +15% attack speed (Teapot allies)
  - +10% damage
  - +10% explosion radius
  - Drones move faster

After Overheat:
  - 5s Cooling State
  - Reduced attack speed
  - No Heat generation

🔥 OVERCORE — Evolution of Boiler

Permanent Scaling Furnace Core

⚔️ Attack — Steam Piston Slam (SPS) — Enhanced

Same base attack but with scaling improvements.
Can hit air now.

🌡 Heat System (Reworked — Always Active Scaling)

No Overheat burst mode.
No cooldown crash.

Buffs scale continuously based on Heat %.
Heat decays slowly when not generating.

📊 Scaling Buffs (Affects ALL Teapot Allies)

Includes:
- Newell
- Cesus
- Chronos
- Zenith
- All drones

🔹 0–25% Heat
+3% attack speed

🔹 26–50% Heat
+6% attack speed
+5% explosion radius

🔹 51–75% Heat
+9% attack speed
+8% damage
+8% explosion radius

🔹 76–100% Heat
+12% attack speed
+12% damage
+12% explosion radius
Drones move 10% faster

🔥 SPS Range Scaling (Overcore Only)

🌡 0–39% Heat
Normal range

🌡 40–79% Heat
+5% forward reach

🌡 80–100% Heat
+10% forward reach

More Heat = more pressure = longer piston extension.

🔥 Scald (Overcore Version)

Still activates at >40% Heat.
Same burn + -5% attack speed effect.

But since Heat is easier to maintain,
Scald uptime becomes more consistent.
