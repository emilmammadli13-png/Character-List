Aurelion:
- With Newell/Cesus: Aurelion amplifies their explosive volleys and shields them, making them frontline threats.
- With Chronos/Zenith: Aurelion accelerates phase transitions and boosts drone output, turning satellites into battlefield anchors.
- As a trio: Aurelion ties them together into a “storm‑teapot army,” where Bros provide mobile DPS, Satellites provide phased control, and Aurelion ensures they’re stronger together than apart.
