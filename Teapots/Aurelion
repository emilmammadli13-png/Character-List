🟡 AURELION — The Teapot Storm Commander
Attacks
- Command Blast
- Fires a concentrated energy orb that deals medium damage and marks the target.
- Marked enemies take +10% damage from Teapot Bros and Satellites for 3s.
- Drone Escort
- Deploys 2 small drones that orbit Aurelion.
- Drones auto‑attack nearby enemies with light beams.
- If Teapot Bros or Satellites are nearby, drones instead orbit them, granting a temporary shield.

Special Mechanic — Stormlink
- Aurelion creates a link aura around himself.
- Any Teapot Bros (Newell/Cesus) or Satellites (Chronos/Zenith) inside the aura gain:
- Faster target lock
- +8% attack speed
- Minor shield regeneration

Death Effect — Final Directive
- Upon defeat, Aurelion releases a command pulse:
- All Teapot Bros gain +1 teapot volley on their next attack.
- Satellites instantly advance to their next phase.
- This makes his death strategically valuable, forcing opponents to think twice about eliminating him.
