TRANSCENDENT: C.H.R.O.N.O.S. (The Evolution Titan) (Demoted!!!) 

Role: Evolution Specialist / Crowd Control / Apocalypse Tier Theme: A massive mechanical titan that grows in complexity every 10 minutes.
Template: Stage

1. THE EVOLUTION MECHANIC: CHRONO-STAGES 

Chronos evolves every 10 minutes. His progression is slow but grants world-ending power at the 40-minute mark. 
Phase 1 (0-10m): The Prototype. 
Visual: Standard mechanical frame with a single central TV head. 
Display: Permanent White Screen (Static). 
Weaponry: Basic Blade-Claws for melee combat. 

Phase 2 (10-20m): The Broadcaster. 
Visual: 4 additional screens attach to the back (X-configuration). 
Weaponry: Main Hand Blade. A high-frequency sword capable of deflecting Plasma Attacks. 
Ability: Static Pulse. Emits a white noise burst that slows enemy reaction times. 

Phase 3 (20-30m): The Reactor. 
Mechanical Shift: Replaces the 4 back screens with 2 Side Screens. 
New Ability: Split-Vision. The side screens can detach and function as autonomous drones. 
Mode Switch: Chronos can switch between the "4-Back Screen" (Defense) and "2-Side Drone" (Utility) modes, but must stand still for 5 seconds to reconfigure. 
New Display: Orange Screen. Emits thermal radiation that applies a "Burn" effect to all nearby enemies. 

Phase 4 (30-40m): The Glitch Architect. 
New Ability: Spatial Displacement (Teleportation). Chronos can teleport his entire body or partial sections (like a hand) across the battlefield. 
New Ability: THX Sonic Blast. A massive acoustic shockwave that knocks enemies back and disrupts energy shields. 
New Display: Purple Screen. Unlocks Purple Screen Stun, making targets completely stunned. No movements, no thinking, no attacking. 

Phase 5 (40m+): THE CINEMATIC OVERLORD. 
New Display: Red Screen. Unlocks Red Light Hypnosis, making enemies kill themselves if caught. 
New Weaponry: The Astro Hand. A massive mechanical claw located behind the chassis. 
Versatility: Can reach over the shoulders to strike at the front. 
The Redirect: Can grab any projectile (including bullets) and redirect them back at the sender with 100% accuracy. 

2. SIGNATURE ABILITIES 

A. Red Light Hypnosis (Phase 5) 
Effect: The deep red glare forces targets into a trance for 6 seconds. 
Passive: The heat from the red light melts armor, dealing continuous tick damage. 

B. THX Sonic Blast (Phase 4-5) 
Effect: A wide-area blast that vibrates the atmosphere. 
Synergy: Increases the radius and effectiveness of all active Screen colors (Orange/Red) for 5 seconds after use. 

C. The Synergy Beam (Phase 3 Core) 
Offensive: High-damage laser fired from the central chest core. 
Support: Can be fired at allies to restore their energy and boost their damage output. 

3. PASSIVE: EVOLUTIONARY HULL 
Phase 1: 85,000 HP. 
Phase 3: 200,000 HP. 
Phase 5: 500,000 HP. 
Growth: Chronos grows significantly in size at each 10-minute interval. 

4. COMBAT STRATEGY: "THE 40-MINUTE CLOCK" 
The Early Game: Stay behind FALANX and use Phase 2's blade to protect the team from plasma fire. 
The Transition: At Phase 3, use the Orange Screen to clear out smaller enemies and deploy drones to scout the map. 
The Endgame: Once Phase 5 is reached, use the Astro Hand to catch enemy fire and the Red Screen to disable the opposition. At this stage, Chronos is essentially a one-man army. 
Note: This character has been demoted from transcendent list. Reason for this is the lack of power, and being countered easily.
