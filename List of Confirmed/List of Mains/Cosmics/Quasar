Quasar (Techframe – Ascended Frame)
- Base Attacks:
  - Photon Burst → Piercing beam of light.
  - Graviton Pulse → Shockwave that pushes enemies outward.
  - Singularity Shot → Mini black hole that pulls enemies in before collapsing.
    - Radiation Effect: All attacks apply Radiation stacks. More stacks = more damage taken + threshold debuffs.
- Abilities:
  - Event Horizon → Creates a warped zone; enemies inside are slowed and accumulate Radiation faster.
  - Stellar Flare → Massive energy eruption that blinds enemies briefly and deals AoE damage.
- Passives (5+):
  - Radiant Core → Damage increases the longer Quasar stays in combat.
  - Gravity Well → Enemies near Quasar move slower.
  - Light Absorption → Gains shields when hitting enemies.
  - Cosmic Echo → Abilities leave lingering aftereffects (burn, slow, pull).
  - Void Resilience → Reduced damage from ranged attacks.
- Modules:
  - Quantum Stabilizer → Reduces cooldowns when below 50% HP.
  - Dark Matter Reactor → Boosts AoE radius of abilities.

  - Fires micro‑lasers, grants Quasar +5% damage.
  - Explodes into radiant blast when destroyed.
- Mothership:
  - Celestial Array → Can now be aimed at a chosen battlefield zone, calling down precision cosmic beams.
