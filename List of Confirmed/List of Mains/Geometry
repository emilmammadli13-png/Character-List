TRANSCENDENT : Geometry (The Architect) (NERFED)

Role: Spatial Manipulator / Tactical Architect / Logic-Breaker

Template: Tool

1. Passive – The Architect’s Form

Geometry exists as a shifting Tesseract (4D Hypercube).

Passive Evasion: 25% chance to evade projectiles that do not intersect with his current 3D slice.

Vertex Health: 8 Golden Vertices. Each can only be destroyed by a single high-damage hit. Rapid-fire weapons now deal minor damage to vertices.

2. Spatial Tools
A. Non-Euclidean Loops (The Face-Portal)

Creates two linked faces in space. Entering one exits the other. Exit speed slightly reduced.

B. Icosahedron Cage (The Shifting Prison)

Traps enemies inside a 12-faced icosahedron. Destroyed faces reposition minimally. Interior is a partial Zero-G zone; flying and high jumps slightly reduced.

C. Polygonal Flux (The Shifting Canvas)

Cycles through polygons that apply effects:

Triangle: Deals minor piercing damage every second.

Square: Solid cage blocking movement.

Pentagon: Reduces incoming damage for allies inside by 20%.

Hexagon: Heals allies and restores energy slowly.

Octagon: Projects shockwave every 3 seconds, smaller pushback.

D. Parallel Plane (Phase Shift)

Allies standing on this plane enter semi-ghost form. Partially avoids damage and projectiles pass through partially. Enemies can still target and hit them.

E. Symmetry Mirror (Reflection/Duplication)

Reflects friendly projectiles to the other side. Only projectiles below a certain size/damage are affected. Enemy projectiles reflected similarly.

3. Ultimate – Dimensional Crush

Compresses space in a 30m radius. Slows enemies and deals minor AoE damage. Small knockback applied. Does not drastically alter enemy movement or dimensions.

4. Macro-Geometry – The Mobius Strip

Turns a section of the battlefield into a limited Mobius loop. Loop radius and duration reduced; enemies may escape faster.

5. Passive – Golden Ratio

Every 10th ability used is "Perfect": size doubled only for weaker abilities, cooldown halved. Heals 1 vertex.

Axis Alignment: Deals 20% more damage to enemies at 90°, 180°, 270° relative to core.

6. Dimensional Shift (Phase Shift Escape)

Becomes semi-transparent and moves 50% faster for 3 seconds. Takes 50% damage while phased and cannot attack.
