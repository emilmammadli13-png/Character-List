TRANSCENDENT VI: P.H.A.N.T.A.S.M. (The Mirror Shadow) 

Role: Optical Assassin / UI Saboteur / Stance-Switcher Theme: A digital ghost that exists between the frames of reality. Phantasm does not "evolve" over time; he "shatters" his identity into different combat roles. 

1. THE FRACTURED CORE (Identity System) 

Phantasm does not have levels. Instead, he has 3 Personas. Switching between them has no cooldown but requires a "Memory Sync" (performing a specific action). 

Persona I: The Echo (The Decoy) 

Visual: A shimmering, low-resolution version of Phantasm. 

Passive: Afterimage. Every movement leaves a trail of 5 static holograms. Enemies' auto-aim will target these holograms instead of the real Phantasm. 

Weapon: Pulse Needles. Rapid-fire light darts that deal low damage but mark targets for the other personas. 

Persona II: The Wraith (The Stealth) 

Visual: Near-total transparency with glowing purple "eyes." 

Passive: Data Leak. While in this stance, Phantasm is completely silent. He can walk through solid walls, but doing so drains his "Stability Meter." 

Weapon: Void Blade. A melee strike that deals massive damage if delivered from behind or while invisible. 

Persona III: The Glitch (The Saboteur) 

Visual: A flickering, distorted mess of pixels and light. 

Passive: UI Corruption. Simply standing near an enemy causes their screen to shake, their mini-map to spin, and their health bar to show random values. 

Weapon: Logic Bomb. Fires a slow-moving orb. Upon impact, it forces the enemy's last used ability to go on a 15-second "Reset" cooldown. 

2. SIGNATURE MECHANIC: THE MIRROR BARRIER 

Unlike Falanx's physical shield, Phantasm has a Light-Refraction Field. 

The Logic: This field has 0 HP. Instead, it has a "Miss Rate." 

At base, 40% of all incoming projectiles simply pass through Phantasm. 

Synergy: If Phantasm is in The Echo persona, the miss rate increases to 70%. 

3. UNIQUE ABILITY: "CLIPBOARD STEAL" 

Phantasm can "capture" the last projectile or ability fired at him. 

Effect: He stores the data of the attack. 

The Replay: He can then fire that exact same attack back at the enemy, but it appears as a "Holographic" version that deals 75% of the original damage. 

4. ULTIMATE: THE GRAND ILLUSION 

Phantasm disappears from the map entirely for 12 seconds. 

The Hallucination: Every enemy on the map sees a "Boss Version" of Phantasm appearing directly in front of them. 

The Reality: While the enemies are fighting their own personal "Boss," the real Phantasm is free to move around the map and execute targets. 

The Reveal: When the 12 seconds are up, all damage dealt by the "Boss" illusions is instantly applied to the enemies as "Sync Damage." 

5. PASSIVE: OPTICAL ADAPTATION 

Darkness Vision: Phantasm sees perfectly in smoke, fog, or darkness. 

Frame-Skip: When Phantasm takes a hit that would deal more than 20% of his Max HP, he "Skips a Frame," teleporting 5 meters in a random direction and negating the damage entirely. (Cooldown: 20 seconds).
