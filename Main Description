# Character-List
Welcome People! This is a list of the characters that I've made when I had and have free time.
They are really unique, and take inspiration from some other things.
I probably add some other things to my characters such as "templates". 
They are from the old times of making the characters, so dont mind them.
Formating, ideas and other things are helped by AI.
