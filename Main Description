# Character-List

WELCOME, WELCOME!!! Hey there, how are you doing? If you are wondering what this repository is about, this is about the characters that I make when have free time.
Most of them are very strong, and there could be format differences, they will change soon. 
There are kind of tiers at my character rating, the highest one being the "Transcendent". Those charaters have something called "Templates". But I think of removing them. 
So this will give me no restriction to make characters. There are also "Frames". They also are like the templates, but they are different. The Frames are divided into tiers.
Those tiers are being Foundation, Enhanced and Ascended. But soon, I will remove them soon.
Feel free to enjoy reading the characters I've made.
