# Character-List

Welcome, welcome. This is a Repository about the fictional characters that I've made with blood, tear and sweat. Those characters are very strong on their own. But there is a thing. When I make charcaters, 
some of them might be either weak or strong to be graded Transcendent. But some of them might have a comeback. There is a feature called "Template". Which is the main option at every character I'm going to make. 
Templates are going to be done with the 10 main Transcendents. The type of Transcendent does not matter. If a Transcendent has made its own template, it will be coutned as a template. Here is the list of Templates:
1) Component - This is about having different weapons, drones, motherships, pilots and anythin you can think of.
2) Core - Combining different types together to make a strong character.
3) Scaling - Having a chosen stat, and make it stronger and stronger.
4) Arsenal - Having so many drones, weapons, abilities is never bad thing to have.
5) Type - If you want to have different types of abilities, this is great for you.
6) Aging - More you fight, stronger you get.
7) Tool - This is great if you want to have different types of weapons. Different from Arsenal template, making you also being able to have abilities.
8) Bar - Making your abilities be stronger with a certain power. This also can make yourself stronger and enemies weaker.
