TRANSCENDENT : G.E.O.M.E.T.R.Y. (The Architect) (REMOVED!!!)

Role: Spatial Manipulator / Tactical Architect / Logic-Breaker Theme: The absolute control over dimensions, topology, and the mathematical constants of space. 

Template: Tool

1. THE ARCHITECT’S FORM (Passive System) 

Geometry exists as a shifting Tesseract (4D Hypercube). 

The Fourth Dimension: Because his true body is 4D, 3D weapons (bullets, lasers) only hit him if they intersect with his "Current Slice" of reality. This gives him a constant 50% "Passive Evasion" that cannot be bypassed by accuracy buffs. 

Vertex Health: He has no HP bar. He has 12 Golden Vertices. Each vertex can only be destroyed by a single high-damage hit. Rapid-fire weapons are useless against him. 

2. SPATIAL TOOLS 

A. Non-Euclidean Loops (The Face-Portal) 

The Mechanic: Geometry chooses two points in space and manifests two glowing Geometric Faces (matching his current shape). 

The Logic: Entering one face instantly exits the other. Unlike standard portals, these maintain "Relative Velocity"—if you run into the first face, you launch out of the second at the same speed. 

B. The Icosahedron Cage (The Shifting Prison) 

The Shape: Geometry traps an enemy inside a massive, 20-sided Icosahedron. 

The Escape: The target must destroy every single one of the 20 faces to get out. 

The Shift: Whenever a face is destroyed, the cage "rotates" its topology, shifting the remaining faces to different positions. 

Grounding Field: The interior of the cage is a "Zero-G Null Zone." Flying abilities and high jumps are disabled. 

C. The Polygonal Flux (The Shifting Canvas) 

The Mechanic: Geometry "sketches" a massive shape on the battlefield. The shape cycles through different polygon counts, each granting a unique "Rule of Law" to the area: 

Triangle (3-Sided): The Spike. Deals piercing damage to enemies every second they remain inside. 

Square (4-Sided): The Block. Acts as a solid cage that prevents all movement in or out of the shape. 

Pentagon (5-Sided): The Guard. Reduces incoming damage for all allies inside by 40%. 

Hexagon (6-Sided): The Hive. Heals allies and restores energy/cooldowns over time. 

Octagon (8-Sided): The Fortress. Projects an outward shockwave every 2 seconds that pushes enemies away from the center. 

D. The Parallel Plane (Phase Shift) 

The Mechanic: Geometry selects a 30m area of the ground and "skews" the coordinate system. 

The Effect: Allies standing on this plane are shifted into a parallel dimension. They remain visible as ghostly outlines and can attack enemies, but enemy projectiles pass through them without dealing damage. 

E. The Symmetry Mirror (Reflection/Duplication) 

The Mechanic: Geometry manifests a shimmering vertical plane (The Axis of Symmetry). 

The Logic: Any friendly projectile that passes through the mirror is perfectly duplicated on the other side. 

Defense: If an enemy projectile hits the mirror, it is reflected back at them with its trajectory perfectly mirrored. 

F. The Euler Path (Vector Traversal) 

The Mechanic: Geometry "draws" a glowing line (an edge) between two points in 3D space. 

The Effect: This path acts as a friction-less rail. Any ally who touches the path is instantly accelerated to 300% movement speed along the vector. 

3. ULTIMATE: THE SINGULARITY POINT (Flattening 2.0) 

Geometry claps his hands, "deleting" the Z-axis in a massive radius. 

Effect: All 3D entities are compressed into 2D planes. 

The "Paper Cut": While flattened, Geometry can "fold" the enemies. Folding an enemy deals 25% of their Max HP as True Damage. 

Result: Enemies emerge from the 2D state with "Structural Instability," taking double damage for 10 seconds. 

4. MACRO-GEOMETRY: THE MOBIUS STRIP 

Active Ability: Geometry turns a section of the battlefield into a Mobius Strip. 

The Nightmare: Enemies trying to run away find themselves walking in an infinite loop. They see their teammates ahead of them, but they can never reach the exit. 

5. PASSIVE: GOLDEN RATIO 

Mathematical Perfection: Every 5th ability Geometry uses is "Perfect." A Perfect ability has double the size, half the cooldown, and heals Geometry for 2 Vertices. 

Axis Alignment: Geometry deals 20% more damage to enemies who are positioned at 90, 180, or 270-degree angles relative to his core. 

6. DIMENSIONAL SHIFT (The Escape) 

Geometry can turn into a 1D Point (a single pixel) for 3 seconds. He becomes completely invincible and invisible, but cannot attack. This allows him to slip through the smallest cracks in enemy defenses. 

 
Note: This character has been removed due to being too strong. But expect a comeback from this character in the future with weaker powers. 
Note: While being a removed one, this one is a main Transcendent for Tool template.
