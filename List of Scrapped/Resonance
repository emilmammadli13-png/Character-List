Transcendent: R.E.S.O.N.A.N.C.E. (The Frequency King) (Demoted!!!) 

Role: Siege Titan / Crowd Control / Multi-Stage Scaler Theme: A massive acoustic juggernaut that uses rhythmic precision to manipulate gravity and structural integrity. 

Template: Bar

1. THE COMPOSITION BAR (Core Mechanic) 

Resonance doesn't just fire weapons; he plays a "Score." Every successful hit builds his Resonance Bar, which is divided into 5 Stages. 

The Note Sequence (Main Attack) 

Resonance's basic attack evolves in a specific rhythm. Missing a beat (missing all notes in a step) resets the sequence to Step 1. 

Step 1: The Solo. Fires a single, high-velocity "Prime Note." 

Step 2: The Chord. (Triggers if Step 1 hits). Fires 4 notes simultaneously in a Square Formation. 

Step 3: The Scale. (Triggers if at least one note from Step 2 hits). Fires 5 notes in a rapid Vertical Line, piercing through enemies. 

2. THE 5-STAGE OVERCLOCK 

As the Resonance Bar fills through successful Note Sequences, his abilities gain "Harmonic Depth": 

Stage 1 (Steady): Base ability effects. 

Stage 2 (Vibrant): All projectile speeds increased by 20%. 

Stage 3 (Resonant): Abilities apply a "Hum" that reveals enemies through walls. 

Stage 4 (Crescendo): Cooldowns are reduced by 30%. 

Stage 5 (Symphonic): Resonance enters "Perfect Pitch." All notes from his main attack become homing, and his abilities deal "True Damage" by bypassing armor. 

3. RESONANT TOOLS 

A. Sympathetic Vibration 

The Logic: Resonance strikes the ground, sending out a pulse. If it hits an enemy, they begin to "ring." 

Stage 5 Bonus: The vibration pulls nearby light objects and smaller projectiles toward the vibrating enemy. 

B. Phase-Oscillation (The Ghost Walk) 

The Effect: Resonance vibrates his molecules to match solid matter, allowing him to walk through walls and shields. 

Stage 5 Bonus: While passing through an enemy, he "shatters" their internal rhythm, silencing their abilities for 2 seconds. 

C. The Gravity Suite (Force & Collapse) 

Part 1: The Pushing Cadence. Resonance fires 5 concentrated, high-impact notes in quick succession. These deal decent damage and significantly knock back any enemy hit. 

Part 2: The Singularity Finale. Immediately following the 5th note, he fires a final, dense "Void Note." 

The Pull: Upon landing, it acts as a mini-black hole, sucking all nearby enemies toward its center while dealing continuous damage. 

The Explosion: When the black hole expires after 3 seconds, it detonates in a massive acoustic burst, dealing heavy damage to everyone trapped inside. 

D. The Tuning Fork 

The Pulse: Manifests a sonic spike that emits "Crasher Waves" every 2 seconds. 

Anti-Armor: Deals 300% bonus damage to energy shields and stationary structures. 

4. ULTIMATE: THE BIG HUM 

Resonance channels for 2 seconds, then releases a low-frequency hum that covers the entire map. 

The Shatter: Any object or unit with less than 15% HP is instantly disintegrated. 

The Silence: Mutes all game audio for 10 seconds, replacing it with a deep, pulsing vibration. 

Molecular Softening: Enemy damage is reduced by 50% as their gear vibrates too violently. 

5. MACRO-RESONANCE: THE ECHO CHAMBER 

The Loop: Targets a 20m zone and "records" sound. Any ability used inside is re-played 3 seconds later. At Stage 5, the recorded ability is played back at 150% power. 

6. PASSIVE: ULTRASONIC SENSOR 

Echolocation: Resonance sees outlines of all moving or noisy entities through obstacles. 

Note: This character is no longer a transcendent. He’s been demoted because of lack of power. Expect a comeback from this character with stronger powers in future.
Note: While being a removed one, this one is a main Transcendent for Tool template.
