TRANSCENDENT III: H.Y.P.E.R.I.O.N. (The Storm Sovereign) 

Role: Aggressive Disruptor / Area Denial / Kinetic Punisher Theme: High-energy ionization, static electricity, and orbital physics. 
Template - Scaling

1. THE FOUNDATION: ION STRIKES (Basic Attack) 
Hyperion uses high-frequency energy punches and slashes to overwhelm targets. 
Charge Marks: Every hit applies a "Charge Mark." 
Ionized Burn (DoT): Any enemy with at least one Charge Mark takes constant, ticking energy damage. This damage-over-time scales higher with every stack applied. 
Decay: Marks decay rapidly if Hyperion stops attacking or moving. 

2. THE CORE: ARC RELEASE (Secondary Attack) 
Hyperion expels all accumulated Charge Marks to trigger a massive discharge. 
The Discharge: Form varies (Chains, Arcs, or Rings) based on current Electron Potential (EP). 
Detonation: If an enemy has max marks, the Arc Release causes a "Circuit Break," stunning them for 1.5 seconds. 

3. ELECTRON POTENTIAL (EP) TIERS 
As Hyperion deals damage and stays aggressive, his EP rises, expanding his power and increasing the Mark Stack Cap: 

Tier 1 (EP 1–6): Ionized Field 
Mark Cap: 5 Stacks. 
Effect: Attacks arc slightly to secondary targets. 

Tier 2 (EP 7–12): Plasma Saturation 
Mark Cap: 8 Stacks. 
Effect: Ionized zones persist on the ground, dealing ramping damage. 

Tier 3 (EP 13–18): Electron Storm 
Mark Cap: 12 Stacks. 
Effect: Overlapping zones trigger "Resonance" bursts. 

Tier 4 (EP 19–24): Critical Mass 
Mark Cap: 15 Stacks. 
Effect: Automatic discharges fire every 3 seconds. Marks detonate upon reaching the cap instead of expiring. 

4. ULTIMATE: DOMAIN EXPANSION (The Electron Domain) 
Hyperion reaches Infinite Potential and forces the battlefield into his "Electron Domain" for 15 seconds. 

TIER 5: THE SKY-CLAD KING 
Mark Cap: 20 Stacks. 
Atmospheric Ionization: While inside the Domain, Hyperion turns the air itself into a conductor. Enemies within 15m gain 1 Charge Mark automatically every 2 seconds. This auto-marking rate is doubled while Hyperion is mid-air. 

DOMAIN EFFECTS 

A. Static Cost (The Movement Tax): Moving or attacking causes instant Charge Mark spikes. 
B. Mark Auto-Linking: Marks form "Lightning Chains" that echo damage between enemies. 
C. Orbital Authority: Projectiles curve away; enemy dashes bend into orbits around Hyperion. 
D. Mass Detonation (The Finale): Map-wide detonation upon Domain expiration. 

5. SPECIAL STATE: SOVEREIGN FORM 
Trigger: This state activates when Hyperion has a total of 30 Charge Marks distributed across any number of enemies (regardless of Domain status). 
The Visual: Hyperion begins to float and manifests two massive wings of pure electrical energy. 

SOVEREIGN ABILITIES 

Main Attack: Heavenly Bolts. Hyperion shoots lightning bolts from his hands. These bolts chain between up to 5 enemies, applying 1 Charge Mark to every enemy hit. 
Secondary Attack (Passive): Autonomous Pinions. The energy wings fire small, constant electric bolts automatically at every enemy within range. Each bolt applies 0.5 Charge Marks. 

6. PASSIVE: CONDUCTIVE HARVEST 
Whenever an enemy is stunned or detonated by an Arc Release, Hyperion restores a portion of his energy and health, fueling his relentless aggression.
